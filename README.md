README.md# QBASIC Hello World Program

This repository contains a simple example of how to write a Hello World program in QBASIC.

## Program Code

```qbasic
PRINT "Hello, World!"
END
```

## How to Run

1. Start QBASIC (usually by typing `qbasic` at the DOS prompt)
2. Type in the program exactly as shown above
3. Press F5 to run the program
4. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen

## Notes

- QBASIC was included with MS-DOS and is a simplified version of QuickBASIC
- The PRINT command displays text on the screen
- The END statement is optional but good practice
- Make sure to include the quotation marks around the text you want to print
